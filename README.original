Do: "make install"
  and IGNORE all the warning messages about symbols defined but not used
  ...in due time it will aks for your passwd to "sudo" the instalation
     
     That should do it.

If anything fails... write me (rvr@dcc.fc.up.pt)

enjoy


P.S. If you want to uninstall it you can try "make uninstall", but
because python setup utils do not have any uninstall commands, it is a bit
of a improvisation, that we hope to work on most of the systems.
